# Drawer

## What is this?

This is a toy project to learn about parsing and rendering DSLs, and looking around in the fp world.

## What is a DSL?

A DSL is a Domain Specific Language.



## Update

- It now works! ðŸŽ‰

- I just said goodbye to fp principles and it was really easy to fix xD (skill issues).

- Probably should reconsider how the parsing works but for now it just works.

## How to use? 

- As long as the use the same format in the `shapes.dsl` file, it should work.

- `shapes.dsl` is the file that contains the shapes that you want to draw.

- It needs `shapes.dsl` in the same directory as the `run.php` file.

- You just `php run.php` and it will output the `output.html` file.
